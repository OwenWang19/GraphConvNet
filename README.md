# GraphConvNet
This repository is dedicated to experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for graph-structured data. GCNs are a class of neural networks designed to directly operate on graphs, enabling learning from node features while incorporating the underlying graph structure.

# Features
1.Node Classification: Assign labels to nodes based on their features and graph connectivity.
2.Link Prediction: Predict the likelihood of edges between nodes.
3.Graph Representation Learning: Learn low-dimensional embeddings that capture graph structure and node features.
4.Modular PyTorch Implementation: Flexible codebase for easy experimentation with different GCN variants and datasets.

# Getting Started
